# PcNinja WinUpdate Tool V2.2.5-RC1

V2.2.5-RC1 introduces PcNinja mascot branding for the installed WinUpdate Tool and a separate branded Portable file icon based on the ninja-at-laptop artwork. The installed app, taskbar/window, Start Menu, shortcuts, and uninstall entry use the MSI mascot icon; the downloadable Portable EXE uses its own side-profile ninja-at-laptop icon.

The Windows Update engine, driver audit behavior, interactive MSI wizard, portable packaging, and branded host behavior remain based on the V2 recovery work.

## Version Repositories

- V2 repository: https://github.com/JavierTorresFelendler/PcNinja-WinUpdateTool-V2
- V1 legacy repository: https://github.com/JavierTorresFelendler/PcNinja-WinUpdateTool-V1

Use the V1 repository for the stable V1 download line. Use this repository for V2 stable releases and V2 release candidates.

## New In V2.2.5-RC1

- Replaces the legacy single-frame V2 icon with six-frame, transparent Windows ICO assets (16, 32, 48, 64, 128, and 256 px).
- Keeps the MSI/runtime surfaces on the approved PcNinja mascot icon: installed host, taskbar/window, MSI Add/Remove Programs branding, Start Menu and desktop shortcuts, and in-app header artwork.
- Gives the downloadable Portable EXE a distinct PcNinja-branded ninja-at-laptop file icon so it does not look like the Smart Office installer.
- Keeps the existing V2 update engine, packaging behavior, and CLI flows unchanged while the new visual identity is evaluated as a release candidate.

## New In V2.2.4

- Adds `assets/PcNinja-SoftAlert.wav`, blended from Javier's preferred preview tones.
- Routes V2 dialogs through quiet wrappers so routine informational dialogs are silent.
- Plays the soft PcNinja alert only for important warning, error, and question dialogs.
- Suppresses the default Windows MessageBox icon sound by showing app dialogs with no native MessageBox icon.

## New In V2.2.3

- Fixes portable installs being misdetected as MSI installs during app updates. UAC elevation strips the environment variables set by the portable launcher, so both the branded host and the script now forward the portable source path as a command-line argument across elevation. Portable installs once again download the new portable EXE beside the running file; MSI installs keep the MSI flow.
- Sizes the Drivers `File password` frame to its text instead of a fixed 190px width, so it no longer looks oversized at the minimum window size.

## New In V2.2.2.1 (Stable)

- First official stable release of the V2 line; releases are published from the single `main` branch.
- Keeps a `v2-dev` branch as a read-only compatibility alias of `main` so release-candidate installs (RC18-RC24) continue to receive update prompts at their built-in manifest URL. It is refreshed at each release and is not a development branch.

## New In RC25

- Moves the Logs `Export Bundle` action onto the Application Logs title row, right-aligned above the filter field and always visible.
- Inlines the Retry Policy description with its card title and re-spaces the retry rows with the freed vertical room.
- Removes leftover WinForms anchor settings that fought the responsive layout engine — fixing the stretched log filter box and the `On repeated failure` combo being pushed off the right edge at small window sizes.
- Recomputes the responsive layout every time a tab is opened, so pages opened at a small window size no longer show clipped footers, hidden buttons, or missing scrollbars until a manual resize.
- Reads the tool update manifest from the `main` branch: development now converges on a single stable branch with no separate dev branch.

## New In RC24

- Fixes the V2 window closing seconds after launch. The RC23 WAN IP lookup attached PowerShell script blocks to background process output events; the handlers fired on a thread-pool thread without a PowerShell runspace and terminated the host process. The lookup now uses file-redirected process output, matching the proven pattern used by the scan and update jobs.
- Adds a `PCNINJA_V2_UI_SMOKE_MS` environment override for the UI smoke window (default 1500 ms) so smoke runs can stay open long enough to catch asynchronous startup failures like the RC23 regression.

## New In RC23

- Moves Settings `Clear Schedule` and `Save Schedule` actions to the top header beside Settings and Help.
- Keeps Settings and Logs layouts stable after first paint, maximize, restore, and manual resizing.
- Changes the Help button to open the GitHub V2 user guide.
- Adds logged-on user, LAN/WAN IP, GPU, motherboard, and BIOS summary data to System Status.
- Uses conditional log scrollbars so the log window does not show forced sliders when content does not require them.
- Uses the approved transparent laptop-ninja artwork for the application icon, MSI, Portable EXE, shortcuts, and uninstall metadata; the V2 UI remains unchanged and does not render an in-app logo.

## New In RC22

- Sets a larger V2 minimum window size based on VM layout validation.
- Moves Settings Save/Clear schedule actions into the upper schedule area.
- Fixes the `Windows & Office Activation` label so the ampersand displays correctly.
- Moves the Logs filter field beside `Open Log File`.
- Replaces the small white-backed header icon with a cropped dark-background PcNinja logo.
- Rewrites restart-state details so users see a clear restart/no-restart message instead of raw registry diagnostics.

## New In RC21

- Moves the Schedule helper text below the schedule fields to avoid visual interference with the time selector.
- Renames the Drivers tools panel to `PcNinja Free Tools`.
- Simplifies the Drivers tool links to `Driver Updater`, `Smart Office Installer`, `Windows & Office Activation`, and `Custom PcNinja Images`.
- Reapplies tab layout after form and tab-host resize events so restored windows keep all top tabs visible.
- Keeps MSI/ProductVersion metadata aligned so Windows uninstall views match the RC build.
- Uses invariant English date formatting in the V2 UI even on non-English Windows locales.
- Enables double buffering on the V2 form, panels, and cards to reduce resize/redraw artifacts.
- Keeps long log lines on one line with horizontal scrolling so live-follow does not jump during wrapped lines.
- Automatically checks the GitHub update manifest after the UI opens.
- Shows a version-aware update dialog only when a newer release is available.
- Starts a relaunch watcher for MSI updates so the app closes for installation and opens again after the installer finishes.
- Downloads portable EXE updates beside the current portable file, then closes the old UI and starts the new EXE.
- Removes unwanted Dashboard scrollbars in the normal window size.
- Adds a public support log bundle export button in Logs.
- Updates footer result status after scans and background runs complete.

## Earlier RC18 Startup Work

- Shows the window first, then loads settings, schedule status, restart status, dashboard status, and logs in short deferred steps.
- Adds clear loading text in the footer during startup and delayed tab refreshes.
- Caches short-lived GUI status checks so switching back to Dashboard does not immediately re-query Windows Update, Task Scheduler, and reboot state.
- Keeps explicit Refresh, schedule changes, and finished update runs using fresh status checks.

## Earlier RC17 UI Note

- Shortens the Windows Update snooze dialog buttons to `Snooz to run`, `Retry in 5 min`, and `Cancel`.

## New In RC16

- Shows the `Snooz to run` choice when Windows Update is active, including servicing/install activity.
- Allows a manual run to snooze Windows Update services and continue instead of immediately scheduling a retry.
- Adds `Wake the computer to run this task` to the scheduled task settings.
- Adds CLI and MSI property support for wake-to-run scheduling.
- Changes default first retry delay from `15` minutes to `5` minutes.
- Changes default retry cooldown from `15` minutes to `5` minutes.

## New In RC14

- Changes the product version to `1.0.14.0` so MSI major upgrades can detect and replace older `1.0.13.x` builds.
- Keeps one stable default install path: `C:\Program Files\PcNinja\WinUpdateTool`.
- Keeps normal interactive installs asking for the install folder.
- Keeps silent `/qn` MSI deployment with `PCNINJA_*` properties.
- Removes the MSI JSON deployment example for now.

}
```

Example remote status check:

```powershell
Invoke-Command -ComputerName PCNAME -ScriptBlock {
    & "C:\Program Files\PcNinja\WinUpdateTool\WinUpdateTool.ps1" -Mode Status -Json
}
```

## New In RC9.5

- If the user clicks `Run Update Now` while Windows Update or Windows servicing is actively installing, the UI schedules an automatic retry immediately.
- If background Windows Update activity is detected and the user chooses not to stop it, the UI schedules an automatic retry immediately.
- The retry still uses the configured retry delay, max retries, and retry backoff.
- The existing Task Scheduler one-time retry remains the persistent mechanism.
- While the app window is open, a lightweight UI retry monitor also starts the retry when the scheduled retry time arrives. The run lock prevents duplicate runs if Task Scheduler starts it at the same time.
- The user can still click `Run Update Now` manually at any time to try again.

## New In RC9.4

- Shows retry status as three short lines:

```text
Next retry
Attempt
Reason
```

- Keeps the full retry reason in logs/state, but uses a shorter readable reason in the UI.
- Gives the retry-status label more space and a smaller normal-weight font.
- No update, driver, or scheduling behavior changed in this build.

## New In RC9.3

- Makes the retry-policy group taller.
- Aligns the retry numeric row with more vertical breathing room.
- Moves scheduled-task status and recent-log controls down as a group.
- No update, driver, or scheduling behavior changed in this build.

## New In RC9.2

- Widens and centers the schedule/retry numeric fields.
- Improves retry-policy spacing so values are visible next to their spinner buttons.
- No update, driver, or scheduling behavior changed in this build.

## New In RC9.1

- Pending file rename operations are now classified instead of treated as an automatic hard reboot requirement.
- Windows Update runs are still blocked by real servicing/reboot markers:

```text
Component Based Servicing\RebootPending
WindowsUpdate\Auto Update\RebootRequired
Pending computer rename
Pending file renames under Windows servicing, update, driver, DriverStore, or INF paths
```

- Generic pending file rename operations are logged as warnings and do not block the update flow.
- Adds:

```text
Uninstall-WinUpdateTool.cmd
```

- Reduces the default UI height and enables scrolling fallback so the bottom status line and `Exit` button remain reachable.

## New In RC9

- Adds a `Driver Inventory` panel in the UI.
- Creates CSV, JSON, and TXT driver inventory reports.
- Collects device names, classes, providers, versions, dates, INF names, device IDs, hardware IDs, compatible IDs, OEM/model, BIOS, and OS details.
- Marks high-confidence vendor-driver comparison candidates using hardware-ID patterns similar to commercial driver tools:

```text
PCI\VEN_xxxx&DEV_xxxx
HDAUDIO\FUNC_xx&VEN_xxxx&DEV_xxxx
USB\VID_xxxx&PID_xxxx
HID\VID_xxxx&PID_xxxx
SCSI\...
```

- Filters common generic/noisy entries such as generic disks, optical drives, software/root devices, USB storage, and generic HID/ACPI entries.
- Does not download or install third-party drivers.
- Adds CLI report mode:

```text
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\WinUpdateTool.ps1 -Mode DriverReport
```

Reports are saved to:

```text
C:\ProgramData\PcNinja\WinUpdateTool\DriverReports
```

Important: `UpdateCandidate` in the report means the device is useful for vendor-driver comparison. It does not mean the installed driver is outdated.

## New In RC9

- Fixes a PowerShell collection unwrapping issue that could stop the run after discovery with: `The property 'Count' cannot be found on this object`.

## From RC8

- Default startup delay remains `15` minutes. Default first retry delay and cooldown are now `5` minutes.
- Runs explicit discovery scans for broad updates, drivers, and optional updates.
- Merges duplicate updates by Windows Update identity before download/install.
- Detects firmware/BIOS candidates and logs them clearly.
- Firmware/BIOS installation is disabled by default and requires the UI setting `Allow firmware/BIOS updates`.

## From RC7

- Installs updates from the broad missing/non-hidden Windows Update result instead of limiting the install queue to `Type='Software'`.
- Includes `Type='Driver'` updates, which covers driver updates shown under Windows Update -> Advanced options -> Optional updates.
- Adds richer discovery and queue logging with update type, categories, and optional-related flags when Windows exposes them.

## From RC6.1

- Fixes Task Scheduler XML registration by using the SYSTEM SID (`S-1-5-18`) and omitting the rejected `LogonType` XML value.

## From RC6

Schedule modes:

```text
Daily
Weekly
Monthly
Startup
```

Additional schedule options:

- Monthly day of month, limited to day `1-28` for safe every-month behavior.
- Startup delayed trigger.
- Optional startup catch-up for daily/weekly/monthly schedules.
- Run-if-missed behavior through Task Scheduler `StartWhenAvailable`.

## Important Implementation Detail

Windows PowerShell's `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger` does not support monthly triggers.

RC6 now creates the normal schedule task using Task Scheduler XML registration.

This allows the same task to contain:

- Calendar trigger.
- Monthly trigger.
- Boot trigger with delay.
- Run-if-missed setting.

## Schedule Examples

Monthly only:

```text
Frequency: Monthly
Month day: 15
Time: 03:00
Also run after startup: off
```

Monthly plus startup catch-up:

```text
Frequency: Monthly
Month day: 15
Time: 03:00
Also run after startup: on
Startup delay: 15 minutes
Run if missed: on
```

Startup only:

```text
Frequency: Startup
Startup delay: 15 minutes
```

Weekly:

```text
Frequency: Weekly
Day: Sunday
Time: 03:00
```

## From RC5

- Single-instance run lock:

```text
C:\ProgramData\PcNinja\WinUpdateTool\run.lock
```

- Persistent state:

```text
C:\ProgramData\PcNinja\WinUpdateTool\state.json
```

- One-time retry task:

```text
\PcNinja\PcNinja WinUpdate Tool Retry
```

- Retry policy controls.
- Run controller.

## From RC4

- Microsoft Update registration when possible.
- Up to 3 update passes.
- Stop at reboot boundary.
- Broad discovery logging.
- Post-pass verification scan.
